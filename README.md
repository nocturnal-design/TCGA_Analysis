Analysis of TCGA PRAD with a focus on biochemical recurrence.

expression.txt is RNA-seq counts data (diploid samples only) pulled from PRAD Firehose on cbioportal.org.

Note that the patients IDs in the RNA-seq counts data must be formatted as "TCGA-XX-XXXX" in order for the code to work.

You will likely have to remove the last three characters (i.e. You will have to remove the "-01" from "TCGA-XX-XXXX-01").
